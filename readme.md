### My Project

- You can see the demo of this project by visiting this link **https://fanilo-github-jobs.netlify.app/**.

1- In this project, I come accross with a lot of experiences. I find out how useReducer and filter work together. I also install few packages which I never came accross such as react-js-pagination. So, I find out how pagination work in react.

2- This project has few **folders** which contain few files. Fistly, I have ***components***, ***containers***, ***redux*** and ***pages*** folders. In each folder, there are files and six js files. Those two folders are **search** and **style** which contains **style.js** file. In ***search*** folder, there are four js files. Those six files are **FilterByLocation**, **FilterByType**, **MainSearch** and **Search**.

- These are also the 6 js files in the big components
  - header
  - trips
  - account
  - cityDestination
  - book-seat
- In the **pags** folder:
  - Home
  -

- **Containers** folder
  - headerContainer
  - tripsContainer
  - accountContainer
  - cityDestinationContainer
  - book-seat
